Tips:<br/>
Tree generate treeenergie, fungi need feeding to get fungienergie<br/>
and both generate Coenergie when connected: needed by bird and new fungi<br/>
New tree need help to mature, tree can grow too old<br/>
Fungi starve for energie to connect and to help<br/>
Fruit limited, Connection limited<br/>
Fungi feeding may limit fruit creation<br/>
Tree and mushroom need to be connected to call bird....<br/>
